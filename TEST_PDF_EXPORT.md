# PDF Export Feature Test Plan

## Improvements Made

### 1. Map and Legend Sizing Fixes
- **Higher Scale**: Increased capture scale from 1.5x to 2x for better quality
- **Better Dimensions**: Improved minimum capture dimensions (1200x800)
- **Proper Aspect Ratio**: Fixed sizing calculations to maintain map proportions
- **Centered Layout**: Map is now centered horizontally in the PDF
- **Maximum Height**: Limited to 200mm to fit properly on page

### 2. Enhanced Capture Settings
- **Foreign Object Rendering**: Better SVG and complex element capture
- **Background Color**: Explicit white background to avoid transparency issues
- **Render Delay**: Added 100ms delay to ensure elements are fully rendered
- **Container Preservation**: Maintains original container structure during capture

### 3. PDF Layout Improvements
- **New Page Logic**: Map gets its own page if space is limited (< 120mm remaining)
- **Section Headers**: Clear section titles for better organization
- **Progress Updates**: More granular progress tracking (30% → 40% → 80%)
- **Descriptive Notes**: Added notes about what's included in the map capture

## Test Instructions

1. **Navigate to Dashboard**
   - Open the D2 Nutrition Vibes application
   - Go to the Dashboard panel

2. **Configure Test Data**
   - Select a product (e.g., "Wheat and products")
   - Choose a metric (e.g., "Production")
   - Select a year (e.g., 2022)
   - Optionally select a country

3. **Verify Map Visibility**
   - Ensure the world map is displayed
   - Check that the legend is visible above the map
   - Confirm colors and data are properly loaded

4. **Export PDF**
   - Click the green "Export PDF" button
   - Wait for the export progress to complete
   - Check that PDF downloads automatically

5. **Validate PDF Content**
   - Open the downloaded PDF
   - Check page 1: Header, overview cards, metrics summary
   - Check page 2: World map with legend properly sized and centered
   - Verify all text is readable and properly formatted

## Expected Results

### Map and Legend Quality
- ✅ Legend should be clearly visible above the map
- ✅ Color scale should be crisp and readable
- ✅ Map colors should match the legend accurately
- ✅ Country boundaries should be sharp and clear
- ✅ Map should be centered on the page
- ✅ Proper aspect ratio maintained (no stretching)

### Overall PDF Quality
- ✅ Professional layout with proper spacing
- ✅ All text elements clearly readable
- ✅ Consistent fonts and styling
- ✅ Proper page breaks and pagination
- ✅ Complete data capture (cards, metrics, countries, map)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Map appears blurry
**Solution**: Increase the `scale` parameter in html2canvas settings

### Issue: Legend cut off or missing
**Solution**: Check that the `data-tour="world-map"` container includes both map and legend

### Issue: Colors don't match
**Solution**: Ensure proper background color and transparency handling

### Issue: PDF too large
**Solution**: Adjust image quality parameter in `toDataURL()` call

## Technical Notes

The PDF export now captures the entire visualization container which includes:
- MapLegend component (with color scale, filters, and scheme selector)
- WorldMap component (with SVG map, country colors, and zoom state)
- All current user selections and filters
- Proper responsive layout matching the dashboard view

The capture happens at 2x scale for crisp rendering, then is optimally sized to fit within PDF margins while maintaining aspect ratio.

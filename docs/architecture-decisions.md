## ADR-001: Vue.js 3 with Composition API

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2024-01-15

**Context**:
The original application was built with vanilla JavaScript, which made it difficult to manage state, organize code, and implement complex data visualizations. We needed a modern framework that could handle reactive data binding, component-based architecture, and integrate well with D3.js.

**Decision**:
We chose Vue.js 3 with the Composition API as our frontend framework.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- React with hooks
- Angular 15+
- Svelte/SvelteKit
- Staying with vanilla JavaScript

**Rationale**:
- **Gentle Learning Curve**: Vue.js is easier to adopt for developers familiar with HTML/CSS/JS
- **Composition API**: Provides better TypeScript support and code reusability
- **D3.js Integration**: Vue's reactivity system works well with D3.js data binding
- **Performance**: Vue 3's proxy-based reactivity is more performant
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem with Pinia, Vue Router, and extensive tooling

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**:
  - Reactive data binding simplifies state management
  - Component-based architecture improves code organization
  - Better development experience with Vue DevTools
  - Strong TypeScript support
  - Excellent documentation and community support

- **Negative**:
  - Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Vue
  - Additional build complexity compared to vanilla JS
  - Bundle size increase (mitigated by tree shaking)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Considerations

- **Data Gaps**: Some countries/years may have incomplete data (especially 2020-2022)
- **Lag Effects**: Events may show delayed impacts (e.g., 2010 drought ‚Üí 2011 prices)
- **Attribution**: Multiple concurrent events complicate analysis (e.g., 2020-2022)
- **Scale**: National averages may hide regional extremes
- **Uncertainty**: Differentiate correlation from causation

---

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done

Each event implementation is complete when:
- [ ] Data anomaly is clearly visible in visualizations with correct year
- [ ] Event is properly annotated across all relevant modules with dates
- [ ] Impact magnitude matches documented expectations for that year
- [ ] Export functionality includes event context and timeline
- [ ] Documentation explains interpretation with temporal context
- [ ] Performance remains acceptable (<3s load time) for 13 years data
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified for all year selectors
